Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Raphael.

I am currently working in software analysis at a company focused on the agribusiness sector.

At present, I am studying at FIAP in a postgraduate course: Software Systems Architecture with Azure, where I am learning how to build software with modern and efficient architecture using C# 12, DevOps, Serverless, Microservices, Clean Architecture, Agile methodologies, Docker and more.

Over the past 7 years, I've worked with .NET, SQL, Docker, and other technologies. I started by providing support to software users, and later transitioned to working with APIs and partner integrations.

I have developed APIs to integrate with e-commerce platforms, enabling the sale of their products, as well as facilitating the reverse process.

Currently, I am working with SAP, building software and integrations to improve processes in agriculture.

It's a very challenging area that is essential to our daily lives. It's incredible to work in Brazil's largest sector.
